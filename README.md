# Customer-Churn-Revenue-Analysis-SQL-Project-
##  Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer purchasing behavior and identifying churn using structured transactional data. The analysis is performed using SQL on a relational database containing customers, orders, products, and order-level details. The goal is to derive meaningful business insights such as customer lifecycle status, revenue trends, and customer lifetime value, and then present these insights through a visualization layer.

The project is designed to simulate a real-world analytics workflow where SQL is used as the primary tool for data extraction, transformation, and analysis.

----------

##  Objectives
The key objectives of this project are:

-   To analyze overall and monthly revenue performance   
-   To understand customer purchasing behavior   
-   To classify customers into lifecycle segments (Active, Churned, Never Converted)   
-   To identify high-value customers and top-performing products   
-   To calculate business metrics such as average order value and customer lifetime value  
-   To prepare SQL outputs suitable for business intelligence visualization
    

----------

## Tools & Technologies
-   **SQL (PostgreSQL-compatible syntax)** for data analysis   
-   **Relational database design** with normalized tables   
-   **Power BI** used only as a visualization layer  
-   Analytical techniques including aggregations, joins, CTEs, and window functions
    

----------

##  Data Model Overview
The database is structured using a normalized relational schema to ensure data integrity and analytical flexibility.

### Core Tables:
-   **Customers** – stores customer details and signup information
-   **Products** – contains product names, categories, and pricing
-   **Orders** – captures order-level data including order dates and status
-   **Order Items** – stores line-item level details such as quantity and item price
    

### Relationships:
-   One customer can place multiple orders
-   Each order can contain multiple products
-   Products can appear in multiple orders
    
This structure supports both customer-level and product-level analysis.

----------

## Revenue Analysis
Revenue analysis focuses on understanding how sales are generated across time, customers, and products.

Key analyses include:
-   **Total revenue** generated from all completed transactions
-   **Monthly revenue trends** to identify growth, decline, or seasonality
-   **Month-over-month revenue change** to measure performance momentum
-   **Revenue by customer** to identify top contributors
-   **Revenue by product and category** to evaluate product performance
  
These insights help businesses understand where revenue is coming from and how it evolves over time.

----------

##  Customer Behavior Analysis
Customer behavior is analyzed by examining order frequency, recency, and total spending.

The project identifies:
-   **One-time customers** versus **repeat customers**
-   Customers with high purchasing frequency
-   Customers contributing the most revenue over time

This analysis supports customer segmentation and retention strategies.

----------

## Customer Churn Logic
A core focus of the project is identifying customer churn using transaction history.

Customers are classified into three lifecycle segments:
-   **Active**: Customers who have placed a completed order within a recent time window  
-   **Churned**: Customers whose last completed purchase occurred beyond the defined inactivity threshold   
-   **Never Converted**: Customers who signed up but never placed a completed order
  
This classification is based on the **last completed order date**, a common industry approach for churn analysis.

----------

## Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)

Customer Lifetime Value represents the total revenue generated by a customer across all their completed purchases.

By calculating LTV:
-   High-value customers can be identified
-   Revenue concentration can be analyzed
-   Business decisions related to customer retention and targeting can be supported
    

----------

## Visualization Layer
While all business logic and analysis are performed in SQL, the results are visualized using Power BI to enable interactive exploration.

The dashboard includes:
-   KPI summaries (customer counts, churn rate, revenue)
-   Monthly revenue trend analysis
-   Revenue breakdown by customer and product
-   Customer count by lifecycle status
  
Customers with no transactions are intentionally excluded from revenue-based visuals but included in customer count metrics to ensure accurate business representation.

----------

## Key Insights & Learnings
-   Demonstrates how SQL can be used to perform end-to-end analytical workflows
-   Highlights the importance of distinguishing transactional and non-transactional customers  
-   Shows how churn logic can be implemented using simple, explainable rules    
-   Reinforces best practices in relational data modeling    
-   Bridges SQL analysis with business intelligence visualization
    

----------

## How to Use This Project
1.  Execute the SQL scripts to create tables and populate data    
2.  Run analytical queries from the provided SQL files   
3.  Review query outputs or load them into a BI tool for visualization    
4.  Explore insights related to revenue, churn, and customer behavior
    

----------

## Project Use Case
This project reflects real-world scenarios commonly encountered in data analyst and business analyst roles, particularly in e-commerce and subscription-based businesses.

----------

## Notes
-   SQL queries are maintained in separate files for clarity and modularity
-   The project is intentionally structured to prioritize analytical reasoning over tooling
